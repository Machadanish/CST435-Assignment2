# CST435 Assignment 2 - Parallel Image Processing on GCP

This project implements a high-performance parallel image processing pipeline on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. It applies a suite of five filters to a dataset of 1,000 images using two different Python paradigms to analyze speedup and efficiency scaling.

## 📊 Experimental Results (GCP e2-standard-4)

The following results were collected using a subset of the **Food-101** dataset (100 categories, 10 images each). All speedup calculations are relative to the Multiprocessing 1-worker baseline.

| Parallel Paradigm | Workers | Time (s) | Speedup ($S_n$) | Efficiency ($E_n$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multiprocessing (MP)** | 1 | 13.1108 | 1.00x (Base) | 100.0% |
| **Multiprocessing (MP)** | 2 | 6.0711 | **2.16x** | **108.0%** |
| **Multiprocessing (MP)** | 4 | 4.5623 | **2.87x** | **71.8%** |
| **Concurrent Futures (CF)**| 1 | 11.7781 | 1.11x | 111.0% |
| **Concurrent Futures (CF)**| 2 | 6.2350 | 2.10x | 105.0% |
| **Concurrent Futures (CF)**| 4 | 4.7439 | 2.76x | 69.0% |
